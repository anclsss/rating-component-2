## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### What I learned

React states, passing information through props, and all of that through React forms. Trying to have a single source of thruth. 
How to deploy a React App to Github Pages.

### Continued development

This challenge was way harder than I expected. I guess I didn't understand React states the way I thought I did.
Deployment is difficult. 

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba - Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) - This free course helped me so much. The instructor is really great and examples are reusable.
- [Create-react-app-deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) - How to actually deploy it. This is the hard part.
